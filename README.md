# Code4All

**Code4All** is an application designed for users to take programming challenges, aimed especially at those who want to learn to code but don’t know where to start. If that’s you, then you’ve come to the right place!

The challenges are scored based on correct and incorrect answers, contributing to a global leaderboard where all users are ranked.

One of the standout features of this app is the potential for job offers. Registered companies can access user profiles and rankings, with top performers appearing at the top, increasing their chances of receiving job opportunities.

This project was developed as part of my final-year assignment (PAP) during the 2018/21 academic year in the TGPSI (Technical Course in Management and Programming of IT Systems).
